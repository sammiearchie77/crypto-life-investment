              The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you.
               Before deciding to trade foreign exchange or Contracts for Difference (“CFD’s”) you should carefully consider your trading objectives,

               and therefore you should not deposit money that you cannot afford to lose.
               You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange and CFD trading,
               and seek advice from an independent advisor if you have any doubts.

             <p class="text-secondary py-2"><strong class="mb-1">RISK WARNING:</strong> Trading in Forex and Contracts for Difference (CFDs), which are leveraged products, 
               is highly speculative and involves substantial risk of loss. It is possible to lose all your capital. 
               Your capital is not guaranteed and may go down as well as up. Therefore, Forex and CFDs may not be suitable for all investors.
                Only invest with money you can afford to lose. So please ensure that you fully understand the risks involved. 
                Seek independent advice if necessary.</p>
 
             <p class="text-secondary py-2">CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. 
               Over the past 12 months 54.6% of crypto life investment Limited’s retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with crypto life investment Limited. 
               You should consider whether you understand how CFDs work and whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money.</p>
